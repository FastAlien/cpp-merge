cpp-merge

A tool to produce single file from multiple C/C++ files. By default the produced
content is displayed on the standard output. To store it in a file use option -o
or --output.

Syntax:
  cpp-merge [OPTIONS] <file>

Arguments:
  file
                Input file which will be processed. In most cases it will be
                file with main function.

Options:
  --help
                Show this help text.

  -i <path>, --include <path>
                Path to additional directory where header files are located.
                Program will search for include files first in directory where
                currently processed file is located and then in this directory.

  -s <path>, --source <path>
                Path to additional directory where source files are located.
                After processing all included files, program will try to find
                related source file for each of included local header files. If
                file with same base name and extension .c or .cpp exists, it
                will be appended to the output. Program will search first in the
                same directory where main source file is located and then in
                additional source directory.

  -o <file>, --output <file>
                Store output in a file, instead of displaying it on the standard
                output.
